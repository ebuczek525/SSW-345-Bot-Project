Design
What was most helpful about thinking about the design of the project was that it created a clear vision for what the bot was to be how the interactions between user and bot would work. Thinking about example scenarios and flow maps allowed us to pin down what functions needed to do exactly which helped a lot when implementing. I think the most difficult part was just coming up with the idea and fleshing out the bot. We had a rough idea on what we could possibly do and over the course of the working session is where is was really fleshed out. I would not do anything differently here as it was a good experience having to bring to different ideas together to form a new idea. I will continue to use the example scenarios and the flow charts as I feel they really help with getting to understand the user point of view.

Implementation
What was most helpful about the implementation of our project was just how integrated Jira can already be integrated with messaging platforms that professionals use like Slack. There are already bots that implement Jira ticking to slack or discord and as such there are resources to do similar but not the same things as our project. What was most difficult about the implementation was that none of us have experience making a bot at all and as such a lot of our time was spent researching. There really is not something that can be done differently about that situation as it was just a lack of knowledge. In the future I may work on another bot and investigate how other common dev platforms can be integrated. I know GitHub webhooks are useful and have been used in my Senior D project for a bot in our Discord chat.

Process 
I believe the most helpful thing about implementing Kanban and code review of the project is getting into the agile mindset. As we get closer to graduation and with the recent trend towards the agile methodology, it is even more important now to be current with what the development landscape will be like. Nothing was too difficult for me implementing Kanban or code review as it is something I have worked with a lot since freshman year at several internships. I will continue to use Kanban and code review in the future as it is incredibly useful in the software development process and allows developers to focus efforts and gives direction.

Overall
All these methods I have described can really be integrated together for a smooth, agile workflow. Example scenarios and flow charts give a defining vision, bot creation can give valuable information such as the GitHub bot I described above, and the Kanban and code review allow for feature driven development and concise development that helps especially in todayâ€™s world where many people are working remote.
