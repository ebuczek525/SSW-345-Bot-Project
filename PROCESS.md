Create a markdown file, PROCESS.md, which provides the necessary documentation to describe how your team followed your process.


In your markdown, include:

**⦁	Documentation on story creation and assignment at EACH iteration (one option is to include screenshots of kanban board).**

Reflection: 04/08/20 Up to this point, our process has been fairly simple as we have not yet started the code implementation of the project yet. We have simply been documenting our project management process (using GitHub) through this process document. We have so far included screenshots of our Kanban board progress, as well as some meeting notes and iteration progress. So far, we have completed just one iteration for this project phase, which is the process phase.
