Create a markdown file, PROCESS.md, which provides the necessary documentation to describe how your team followed your process.


In your markdown, include:
⦁	Documentation on story creation and assignment at EACH iteration (one option is to include screenshots of kanban board).
⦁	Any scrum meeting notes.
⦁	Include documentation of EACH iteration end. Include status of completed and incomplete tasks, and a process reflection.
