*D1: 04/08/20*

To do: Congratulate user on task creation (8), Add a task reminder (3)

In Progress: Add a productivity goal (5), 

Complete: Find out how to assign point values to Trello/Jira taks (5)

Reflection: Up to this point, our process has been fairly simple as we have not yet started the code implementation of the project yet. We have simply been documenting our project management process (using GitHub) through this process document. We have so far included screenshots of our Kanban board progress, as well as some meeting notes and iteration progress. We have also created workspaces for Slack, Trello, and Jira which we wil use in various parts of our project implementation. So far, we have completed just one iteration for this project phase, which is the process phase. 

*D2: 04/19/20*

To do: Congratulate user on task completion (8), Add a task reminder (3), Add a productivity goal (5)

In Progress: Set up database (4)

Complete: Figure out how to assign point values to tasks in Trello/Jira (1), Create a bot (3), Add a description and icon for our bot (1), Create our first webhook (2), Send our first message using the webhook (1), Set up webhook for dummy task reminder (3), Set up webhook for dummy task completion (3), Set up webhook for productivity goal (3), Set up web server (4), Set up basic slash command (3)

Reflection: The bot is created and the webhook is ready to be used. Also, a slash command has been created, which will be used to handle the task "Add a productivity goal". The server is created, as well as a secure tunnel for the localhost, using ngrok. The MongoDB files are ready but unused. Now, the integration with Trello/Jira awaits.
