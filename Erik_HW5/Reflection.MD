**Design**

  I think it was very useful for us to write out use cases and draw diagrams. The use cases helped us limit the scope of our system and get a good understanding of the development to come ahead. We wrote the use cases so that we could try our best to strictly adhere to them during development and try not to get sidetracked. The diagrams also helped in this regard, though to a lesser extent. The main benefit of the diagrams was to help us understand the flow of the system and which tools would be necessary for us to use. The most challenging part to me was trying to understand how our bot would function, fundamentally. This is why creating the use cases and flows was so useful. We learned about our project while completing those activities, and the completed use cases and flows helped serve as a guide later during the process. I think that we did well for this portion, but if I would change anything, I think we could've done some more research into different design methods that would fit better for our particular project. As I said, we found this to be very useful, so more relevant methods might have proved even better for our team. 

**Implementation**

N/A, we did not complete the implementation, nor do we plan on doing so.

**Process**

  The kanban was incredibly useful for project planning. We were able to assign tasks, complete with a description, and assign point values that we thought were fair based on the size of the task. The kanban also helped us track our progress over time. Without a Kanban, or any other related tool, we would have been very disorganized. It was difficult to assign tasks evenly. We tried our best to assign point values to tasks that were relatively correct, but still we had some trouble in determining the proper distribution of tasks. I will certainly be using Kanban, or another form of project planning, in the future. In my view, it is a must for any software project. 

**Overall**

  In this case, we mostly stuck to software processes and design methods, as we did not implement the project. However, I can say that the Kanban and design sketches were some of the most useful practices we followed during this project. I think, if we had implemented the project, we likely would have made use of some implementation practices such as different types of testing. This would have solidified our project as taking a more agile approach to software development.
